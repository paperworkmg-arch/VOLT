# GODMODE — AI Development Team
### Powered by NEURON.ONE Architecture

> One person. Many projects. Corporate power in one pair of hands.

GODMODE turns Claude Code into a full AI development team. Multi-agent orchestration, cross-model disputes (Claude + GPT + Gemini), 50+ skills, smart model routing — all configured and ready to use.

Built by a non-programmer using AI. If I can do it, so can you.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="GODMODE Architecture" width="100%"/>
</p>

**Level 1 — Orchestrator**: permanent Claude instance that understands the full picture, knows all skills, and decides how many agents are needed.

**Level 2 — Dynamic Agents**: created per task from skill combinations like LEGO blocks. Live until task is complete, then destroyed.

**Level 3 — External Advisors**: GPT and Gemini connected via MCP servers. Not executors — advisors who give second opinions and participate in cross-model disputes.

### Verify Installation

After restarting Claude Code, check that everything works:

```
You: "What skills do you have?"
→ Claude should list 50+ skills across 11 categories

You: "Run a dispute on Redis vs PostgreSQL for task queues"
→ Claude should start a cross-model dispute (if GPT/Gemini configured)

You: "Review my code for security issues"
→ Claude should activate the code-security skill
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Skills not showing | Check `~/.claude/skills/` has SKILL.md files |
| Plugins not working | Run `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code |
| GPT advisor fails | Run `codex login` in terminal |
| Gemini advisor fails | Run `gemini` once to authenticate |
| "Permission denied" on Mac | Run `chmod -R 755 ~/.claude/skills/` |

## Commands

After installation, these commands are available inside Claude Code:

### Core Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/interview [topic]` | Deep interview before starting a project (6 blocks: business, product, technical, security, launch, marketing) |
| `/dispute [topic]` | Cross-model dispute — Claude + GPT + Gemini debate until consensus |
| `/planning [task]` | Creates 3 tracking files (plan, findings, progress), eliminates drift |
| `/simplify` | 3 parallel agents review and clean code |
| `/cost-estimate` | Estimates project cost at market rates (shows ROI of AI) |
| `/self-improve` | Audits skills and CLAUDE.md, suggests improvements |
| `/codex:review` | GPT code review (read-only) |
| `/codex:adversarial-review` | GPT challenges your implementation decisions |
| `/codex:rescue` | Delegates a stuck problem to GPT |
| `/product-data-audit` | Full product ecosystem audit with interactive HTML report |

### Calling Advisors (natural language)

```
"Ask GPT what it thinks about..."        → GPT advisor
"Ask Gemini to evaluate this design..."   → Gemini advisor
"Run a dispute with GPT and Gemini on..." → Full cross-model dispute
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift+Tab` | Switch modes (Plan / Code / Auto) |
| `Shift+Up` | Agent progress (Agent Teams) |
| `@file` | Add file to context |

## Skills Library

| Category | Skills | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **security** | 8 | OWASP audit, auth patterns, secrets scanning, supply chain, git guardrails |
| **development** | 7 | backend, frontend, database, Python, React, mobile |
| **infrastructure** | 7 | Docker, CI/CD, deploy, DNS/SSL, monitoring, server setup |
| **multimodel** | 7 | GPT advisor, Gemini advisor, adversarial review, LLM council |
| **design** | 5 | UI/UX pro max, components, mobile design, screen-to-code |
| **data** | 5 | scraping, data analysis, knowledge graphs |
| **workflow** | 5 | dispute, interview, planning, self-improve |
| **quality** | 4 | code review, batch operations, integration checks |
| **testing** | 4 | unit tests, E2E, browser testing, app store checks |
| **business** | 3 | cost estimation, marketing, product management |
| **ai-training** | 1 | ML model fine-tuning |

## Cross-Model Dispute Protocol

When you need to make an important technical decision:

```
Round 1: Claude + GPT + Gemini give independent positions
    |
Round 2: Each sees ALL others' positions and critiques
    |
Round 3: Defense + concessions
    |
Consensus? --NO--> Round 4-5: Negotiation
    |
   YES --> Final document with consensus/majority/unresolved
```

All three models participate as equals. No sycophantic agreement — adversarial roles are explicitly assigned.

## 16 Orchestrator Rules

1. **Plan First** — 3+ steps = plan mode, wait for approval
2. **Decompose** — 3+ files = subtasks, max 3-5 agents
3. **Verify** — no DONE without proof
4. **Self-Improve** — record lessons, propose CLAUDE.md updates (with approval)
5. **Security** — WARNING + safe alternative, never insecure patterns
6. **Post-Code** — list risks, test-first on bugs
7. **Permissions** — Auto Mode + deny list
8. **Memory** — hot/warm/cold hierarchy
9. **Output** — 64K tokens max
10. **Auto-Presets** — UI task = +ux skill, API task = +security
11. **Agent Communication Protocol** — JSON envelopes, validation, atomic writes
12. **Error Handling** — 3 classes: invalid spec, timeout, invalid output
13. **Structured Logging** — activity.jsonl for debugging
14. **Scratch Pad** — large outputs to file
15. **Compression** — save state at 70% context
16. **Simple Tasks** — no agents for simple work

## Ecomode (Smart Model Routing)

| Complexity | Model | Use For |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Simple | Haiku/Sonnet | formatting, renaming, git ops |
| Medium | Sonnet | features, bug fixes, code review |
| Complex | Opus | architecture, security audit, disputes |

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need GPT and Gemini?**
No. GODMODE works with Claude alone. GPT and Gemini are optional advisors for disputes and second opinions.

**Q: Is this a framework I need to code with?**
No. It's a configuration layer for Claude Code. You install it and it works. No programming required.

**Q: Can I add my own skills?**
Yes. See `docs/SKILL_GUIDE.md` for the skill format. Skills are just markdown files.

**Q: Will this conflict with my existing Claude Code setup?**
It adds to your `~/.claude/` directory. Back up your existing config before installing.

## Limitations

- This is a **showcase/research project**, not a supported product
- Built and tested on Windows 11 — Mac/Linux should work but not extensively tested
- Skills are opinionated — they reflect one developer's workflow
- External model integration requires separate subscriptions (ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Limited support — issues may not receive replies
